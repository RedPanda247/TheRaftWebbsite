          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            The story follows four college students Randy, Deke, Rachel, and
            LaVerne who went on a trip to a remote lake to celebrate the end of
            summer. Despite the chily weather they decided to swim out to a
            wodden raft floating in the middle of the lake.
            <br />
            On the swim over there however one of the characters, randy, noticed
            a black patch floating on the surface of the water not to far from
            the raft, somewhat remenisant of an oil patch.
            <br />
            At first, they all dismiss it, but Randy notices that it moves
            unnaturally, almost as if it has a mind of its own, and he grows
            more and more weary of it's presense. As they stand on the raft,
            observing the black substance, Rachel accidentally dips her hand
            into the water... Instantly, the creature latches onto her, pulling
            her in. Her body is dissolved and consumed before the others could
            even react.
            <br />
            Panicked and horrified they realize they are trapped on the raft
            with no exit as the entity continues circling them with murderous
            intent, waiting for another opportunity to strike. They spend hours
            in terror, watching as the mass of creature orbits them, reacting to
            their movements and keeping them on their toes.
            <br />
            Deke, observing the entity's movements, notices it attempting to
            squeeze under the raft. Believing this to be an opportunity, he
            contemplates swimming to shore while the creature is beneath them.
            Despite Randy's warning that he might not make it, Deke, confident
            in his swimming abilities, decides to take the risk. However, before
            he can act, the creature seizes him by the foot through a crack in
            the raft's planks. Deke's foot is grotesquely pulled into the narrow
            gap, causing him excruciating pain and leading to his gruesome death
            as the entity pulls his body through the gaps in between the
            planks.â€‹
            <br />
            Left on the raft alone and scared, Randy and LaVerne are left with
            no choice but to stay on the raft only having breif oppertunities to
            rest while they take turns standing and watching the creature while
            the other rests. As night falls they sit close together to stay warm
            which leads them to "physical intimacy", LaVerne lying down on the
            raft has a part of her hair reach the water and the creature latches
            on to it and creeps up to her face and pulling her down in to the
            water, now only Randy Remains.
            <br />
            Alone on the raft Randy is forced to stand up and keep an eye on the
            creature, keeping his guard up at all times. However as time
            progresses he grows exasted and fantisises of any kind of escape,
            becomming more and more hopeless and giving in to his emotions. At
            last he gives in and turns to the creature thinking there was no
            hope for him and that the creature could set him free from his
            suffering, he stared at it's hypnotising shimmering colors, this
            time, he didn't look away.

          <h2>movie</h2>
          <p>
            The Raft was also adapted to film as a segment of the 1987 horror
            anthology movie Creepshow 2

            <br />
            Essentially everything in the movie is the same as the book with
            primarily only the ending being changed for the film. In the movie
            Randy ceases his opportunity to flee when the creature takes LaVerne
            and he manages to swim ashore and escape the monster, or so he
            thinks, since the creature suddenly becomes a wave that engulfs him
            and drags him back into the water.

          <h3>Randy (middle right)</h3>
          <p>
            Randy is the main focus of the book and we get a good insight in to
            his thoughts, feelings and fears
            <br />
            He is a very observant and cautious, and is the first person to
            notice the mysterious black substance
            <br />
            When the group panics by the imminent threat he tries to calm them
            down and think strategically
            <br />
            Despite being close a close friend with Deke they do have some
            tension between each other displayed by their frequent bickering,
            subtitle fight over the girls affection and their self given place
            in the group from their stereotypical characteristics where randy
            dislikes being viewed as the "nerd" of the group
          </p>
          <h3>Deke (right)</h3>
          <p>
            Deke is athletic and confident representing the stereotypical jock
            in the group
            <br />
            He tends to underestimate danger which we see when he believes he
            can outswim the monster
            <br />
            Often acting fearless and making hasty decisions without concern for
            the repercussions
          </p>
          <h3>LaVerne (left)</h3>
          <p>
            LaVerne is a sarcastic and edgy girl who often banters with the
            group
            <br />
            She is emotionally fragile and is deeply affected by the death of
            the others
            <br />
            She is the more streriotypically mean and gonfident girl of the
            group that sides more with Deke
          </p>
          <h3>Rachel (middle left)</h3>
          <p>
            Rachel is kind and gentle with a curious side
            <br />
            She is the more quiet girl slightley representing the steriotypical
            shy girl in the group
            <br />
            She is often open and supportive following the group and bringing a
            calming presence
