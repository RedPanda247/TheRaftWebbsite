          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            The story follows four college students Randy, Deke, Rachel, and
            LaVerne who went on a trip to a remote lake to celebrate the end of
            summer. Despite the chily weather they decided to swim out to a
            wodden raft floating in the middle of the lake.
            <br />
            On the swim over there however one of the characters, randy, noticed
            a black patch floating on the surface of the water not to far from
            the raft, somewhat remenisant of an oil patch.
            <br />
            At first, they all dismiss it, but Randy notices that it moves
            unnaturally, almost as if it has a mind of its own, and he grows
            more and more weary of it's presense. As they stand on the raft,
            observing the black substance, Rachel accidentally dips her hand
            into the water... Instantly, the creature latches onto her, pulling
            her in. Her body is dissolved and consumed before the others could
            even react.
            <br />
            Panicked and horrified they realize they are trapped on the raft
            with no exit as the entity continues circling them with murderous
            intent, waiting for another opportunity to strike. They spend hours
            in terror, watching as the mass of creature orbits them, reacting to
            their movements and keeping them on their toes.
            <br />
            Deke, observing the entity's movements, notices it attempting to
            squeeze under the raft. Believing this to be an opportunity, he
            contemplates swimming to shore while the creature is beneath them.
            Despite Randy's warning that he might not make it, Deke, confident
            in his swimming abilities, decides to take the risk. However, before
            he can act, the creature seizes him by the foot through a crack in
            the raft's planks. Deke's foot is grotesquely pulled into the narrow
            gap, causing him excruciating pain and leading to his gruesome death
            as the entity pulls his body through the gaps in between the
            planks.â€‹
            <br />
            Left on the raft alone and scared, Randy and LaVerne are left with
            no choice but to stay on the raft only having breif oppertunities to
            rest while they take turns standing and watching the creature while
            the other rests. As night falls they sit close together to stay warm
            which leads them to "physical intimacy", LaVerne lying down on the
            raft has a part of her hair reach the water and the creature latches
            on to it and creeps up to her face and pulling her down in to the
            water, now only Randy Remains.
            <br />
            Alone on the raft Randy is forced to stand up and keep an eye on the
            creature, keeping his guard up at all times. However as time
            progresses he grows exasted and fantisises of any kind of escape,
            becomming more and more hopeless and giving in to his emotions. At
            last he gives in and turns to the creature thinking there was no
            hope for him and that the creature could set him free from his
            suffering, he stared at it's hypnotising shimmering colors, this
            time, he didn't look away.
